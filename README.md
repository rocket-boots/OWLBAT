# OWLBAT - A PLATO-like Terminal Library

*Open Web Linked Browser-based Anachronistic Terminal* is a library for a fantasy computer that never existed; based on the [PLATO computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)) circa the 1970's and 80's.

## History of PLATO & OWLBAT

Before the internet, before personal computers, before Pac-Man, before Atari... there was the PLATO system.

The [Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)) system was a state-of-the-art terminal system created in the 1960s, that gained popularity in the 1970s. It featured a 512 x 512 monochromatic plasma display, touchscreen sensor, [keyboard](https://www.google.com/search?q=plato+computer+system+keyboard&source=lnms&tbm=isch), and was networked via a mainframe. Although primarily intended for education, it was nonetheless the birthplace of some of the first computer games ever - including the first CRPG ["dnd"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnd_(PLATO_video_game)) (1974-75), and the first multiplayer games.

The OWLBAT (Open Web Linked Browser-based Anachronistic Terminal) is a retro "fantasy console" (in the vein of [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)) that attempts to recreate the PLATO system experience (circa PLATO IV-V) in a web browser. Keyboard input is sent to a "sever", which responds with a list of basic commands (inspired by PLATO's [TUTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUTOR) language and the [PLATO specs](https://irata.online/assets/s0ascers-045c83081e9ada2008378c3ae6aa62564b213a71decf9fe04608909b91d20ad1.html#C1)) which determine what gets displayed on the terminal screen.

Thanks to [cyber1.org](https://v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/3485244/int10h.org) for providing a PLATO terminal experience, and [int10h.org](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/?2) for the font.

## The OWLBAT Future

It would be great to expand OWLBAT to accomplish a few different goals:

- Showcase the PLATO functionality as an interactive historical novelty
   - Play actual PLATO programs in the browser?
- Provide a platform for making retro - especially terminal-based - games
- Allow multiplayer functionality in the browser
